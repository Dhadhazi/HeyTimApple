Developer at large and drinker of too much coffeeâ˜•... actually, is there such a thing as too much coffee? Love RustðŸ¦€ tolerate JS. Someday will delve more into RubyðŸ’Ž. 
I also work on the Documentation Team at [Vetswhocode.io](https://vetswhocode.io) who were so kind as to introduce me to the crazy world of developing.
